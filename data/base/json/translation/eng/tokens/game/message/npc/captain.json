    "CaptainIntro": "Consider yourself lucky that I'm here! I already have a plan for how we can get out of this situation, but you'll have to gather everything we need by yourself. You can find the resources we need amidst the debris found here on the planet. ^ Firstly, our oxygen and fuel supplies are running low. Secondly, our engines are long worn out. And most importantly, I have no idea where the cosmos map is located.",
    "CaptainPack1": "We still need everything I asked you for! ^ Let me repeat: fuel, oxygen, engines and the cosmos map. ^ Now get going! Chop-chop!",
    "CaptainPack2": "Excellent! The records I found say that the ancient Mayans made the cosmos map long ago and there is even a tip on where to find it. ^ Considering that they guard their recorded knowledge like a castle walls protect those within, it should be safe and sound. ^ Just do not perish like the other antique looters."

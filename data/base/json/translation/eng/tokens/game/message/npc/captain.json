And I already have a plan for how we can get out of this situation, but you'll have to gather everything we need by yourself among the debris of the planet. ^ Firstly, our oxygen and fuel supplies are running low. Secondly, our engines are long worn out. And most importantly, I have no idea where is the cosmos map.",

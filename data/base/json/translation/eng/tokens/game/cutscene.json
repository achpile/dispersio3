As you proceeded into the darkness, it was as if the walls were closing in on you. ^ But there was nowhere to retreat to! Without the map of the cosmos, there was no chance for salvation. ^ Forward! All or nothing!",
    "BossOutro": "The Guardian has been defeated and the map of the cosmos is in your hands! ^ With this knowledge, it's finally time to set out in search of a place to call your new home. ^ I'm sure many other exciting adventures await our heroes, but now is the time for rest and celebration! ^ ^ Thank you for playing Dispersio 3!",

Now the loneliness doesn't worry me, but what do I do now? ^ I think I should consult with the captain, maybe she'll have some good advice on the matter.",

Only God knows what they were really doing there, but this time they've definitely gone too far. ^ It's time to run before it's too late!"

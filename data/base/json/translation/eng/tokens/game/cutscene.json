It was as if the very walls were pressing in on you. ^ But there was nowhere to retreat! Without the map of the cosmos, there was no chance of salvation. ^ Forward! All or nothing!",
    "BossOutro": "The Guardian has been defeated and the map of the cosmos is in your hands! ^ With this knowledge, it's finally time to set out in search of a place to call your new home. ^ I'm sure many more exciting adventures await our heroes, but now is the time to rest and celebrate! ^ ^ Thank you for playing Dispersio 3!",

But what should I do now? ^ I think I should consult with the captain, maybe she'll have some good ideas on the matter.",

And only God knows what they were really doing there. ^ But this time they've definitely gone too far. It's time to run before it's too late!"
